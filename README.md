The InceptionResnetV1 model in your code is pre-trained, meaning it has already been trained on a large dataset and comes with learned weights. Let me break this down for you:

Pre-trained Model
When you initialize the model with pretrained='vggface2':

resnet = InceptionResnetV1(pretrained='vggface2').eval()
You are using a pre-trained version of the model. Specifically:

Dataset: It is pre-trained on the VGGFace2 dataset, a large collection of face images with a wide variety of identities.
Purpose: The model is designed to extract face embeddings (numerical representations of faces) that can be used for tasks like:
Face recognition: Comparing embeddings to determine if two faces match.
Face clustering: Grouping faces based on similarity.
You are not training the model. Instead, you are leveraging its pre-trained weights to generate embeddings.

How the Pre-trained Model Works
Input: A face image (detected and cropped) is passed into the model.
Feature Extraction: The model processes the image through its convolutional layers to generate a 512-dimensional vector, called a face embedding.
Output: The embedding is a compact representation of the face, which captures its unique features.
For example:

Two images of the same person will have similar embeddings.
Embeddings of different people will be distinct.
Use Case in Your Code
Embedding Extraction:

embedding = resnet(face_tensor)
face_tensor is a preprocessed face image.
embedding is a 512-dimensional vector.
Comparison:

You likely use a similarity metric, such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance, to compare embeddings.
Example:


from torch.nn.functional import cosine_similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
If the similarity is high, the faces are likely the same person.

Training the Model
If you wanted to fine-tune the model or train it on your own dataset:

You would initialize the model without pre-trained weights:


resnet = InceptionResnetV1(pretrained=None)
Then train it on your labeled dataset of faces using a supervised learning approach.
However, this is not necessary for most applications because the pre-trained model already performs well for face recognition tasks.

Conclusion
In your case:

The model is pre-trained on VGGFace2.
You are using it as a feature extractor for face recognition, without training or fine-tuning.
